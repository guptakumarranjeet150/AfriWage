# @AfriWage/db

Drizzle ORM schema and connection wrapper for AfriWage's PostgreSQL persistence.

## Scripts

| Command           | Purpose                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm generate`   | Generate a Drizzle migration from a schema change (explicit, local only).                                                                           |
| `pnpm migrate`    | Apply pending migrations to the database named by `POSTGRES_URL` (explicit, local only).                                                            |
| `pnpm type-check` | Strict TypeScript validation of the package source (`tsc --noEmit`).                                                                                |
| `pnpm build`      | Deterministic compile/declaration validation (`tsc`) — output is written to `dist/` for validation only; consumers resolve the package from `src/`. |

## CI contract

`type-check` and `build` are wired into the repository's Turborepo/CI pipeline, so a
malformed schema or index change fails CI before merge. Migration commands
(`generate`, `migrate`) are intentionally excluded from CI and never run against
production — they require a `POSTGRES_URL` and are executed explicitly by a developer.

## Environment

- `POSTGRES_URL` — Postgres connection string read at runtime by `src/index.ts` and by
  `drizzle.config.ts` for migrations.
